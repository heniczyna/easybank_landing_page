// Main SCSS file
// Based on tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoQ6S1a32j8 there is
// @import "variables";
// without additional underscore, however more convenient way for me is adding "_" to match the file names

@import "_variables";
@import "_mixins";
@import "_animations";
@import "_globals";
@import "_header";
